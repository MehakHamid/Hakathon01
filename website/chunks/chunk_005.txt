○  Why:  Physics  calculations  (Rigid  Body  Dynamics)  in  Gazebo/Isaac  are  
CPU-intensive.
 ●  RAM:  64  GB  DDR5  (32  GB  is  the  absolute  minimum,  but  will  crash  during  
complex

scene

rendering).
 ●  OS:  Ubuntu  22.04  LTS .  ○  Note:  While  Isaac  Sim  runs  on  Windows,  ROS  2  (Humble/Iron)  is  
native

to

Linux.

Dual-booting

or

dedicated

Linux

machines

are

mandatory

for

a

friction-free

experience.

2.  The  "Physical  AI"  Edge  Kit  
5  

Since  a  full  humanoid  robot  is  expensive,  students  learn  "Physical  AI"  by  setting  up  
the

nervous

system

on

a

desk

before

deploying

it

to

a

robot.

This

kit

covers

Module

3

(Isaac

ROS)

and

Module

4

(VLA).

●  The  Brain:  NVIDIA  Jetson  Orin  Nano  (8GB)  or  Orin  NX  (16GB).  ○  Role:  This  is  the  industry  standard  for  embodied  AI.  Students  will  
deploy

their

ROS

2

nodes

here

to

understand

resource

constraints

vs.

their

powerful

workstations.
 ●  The  Eyes  (Vision):  Intel  RealSense  D435i  or  D455 .  ○  Role:  Provides  RGB  (Color)  and  Depth  (Distance)  data.  Essential  for  
the

VSLAM

and

Perception

modules.
 ●  The  Inner  Ear  (Balance):  Generic  USB  IMU  (BNO055)  (Often  built  into  the  
RealSense

D435i

or

Jetson

boards,

but

a

separate

module

helps

teach

IMU

calibration).
 ●  Voice  Interface:  A  simple  USB  Microphone/Speaker  array  (e.g.,  ReSpeaker)  
for

the

"Voice-to-Action"

Whisper

integration.

3.  The  Robot  Lab  For  the  "Physical"  part  of  the  course,  you  have  three  tiers  of  options  depending  on  
budget.

Option  A:  The  "Proxy"  Approach  (Recommended  for  Budget)  Use  a  quadruped  (dog)  or  a  robotic  arm  as  a  proxy.  The  software  principles  (ROS  2,  
VSLAM,

Isaac

Sim)

transfer

90%

effectively

to

humanoids.

●  Robot:  Unitree  Go2  Edu  (~$1,800  -  $3,000).  ●  Pros:  Highly  durable,  excellent  ROS  2  support,  affordable  enough  to  have  
multiple

units.
 ●  Cons:  Not  a  biped  (humanoid).  
Option  B:  The  "Miniature  Humanoid"  Approach  Small,  table-top  humanoids.  
●  Robot:  Unitree  H1  is  too  expensive  ($90k+),  so  look  at  Unitree  G1  (~$16k)  
or

Robotis

OP3

(older,

but

stable,

~$12k).
 ●  Budget  Alternative:  Hiwonder  TonyPi  Pro  (~$600).  ○  Warning:  The  cheap  kits  (Hiwonder)  usually  run  on  Raspberry  Pi,  
which

cannot

run

NVIDIA

Isaac

ROS

efficiently.

Theme:

AI

Systems

in

the

Physical

World.

Embodied

Intelligence.

Goal:

Bridging

the

gap

between

the

digital

brain

and

the

physical

body.

Students

apply

their

AI

knowledge

to

control

Humanoid

real-world

environments.

Quarter  Overview  The  future  of  AI  extends  beyond  digital  spaces  into  the  physical  world.  This  capstone  
quarter

introduces

Physical

AI—AI

systems

that

function

in

reality

and

comprehend

physical

laws.

Students

learn

to

design,

simulate,

and

deploy

humanoid

robots

capable

of

natural

human

interactions

using

ROS

2,

Gazebo,

and

NVIDIA

Isaac.

●  Module  1:  The  Robotic  Nervous  System  (ROS  2)  ○  Focus:  Middleware  for  robot  control.  ○  ROS  2  Nodes,  Topics,  and  Services.  ○  Bridging  Python  Agents  to  ROS  controllers  using  rclpy.  ○  Understanding  URDF  (Unified  Robot  Description  Format)  for  
humanoids.

 ●  Module  2:  The  Digital  Twin  (Gazebo  &  Unity)  ○  Focus:  Physics  simulation  and  environment  building.  ○  Simulating  physics,  gravity,  and  collisions  in  Gazebo.  ○  High-fidelity  rendering  and  human-robot  interaction  in  Unity.  ○  Simulating  sensors:  LiDAR,  Depth  Cameras,  and  IMUs.

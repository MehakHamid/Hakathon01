 ○  Capstone  Project:  The  Autonomous  Humanoid.  A  final  project  where  a  
simulated

robot

receives

a

voice

command,

plans

a

path,

navigates

obstacles,

identifies

an

and

manipulates

it.

Why  Physical  AI  Matters  Humanoid  robots  are  poised  to  excel  in  our  human-centered  world  because  they  
share

our

physical

form

and

can

be

trained

with

abundant

data

from

interacting

in

3  

human  environments.  This  represents  a  significant  transition  from  AI  models  
confined

to

digital

environments

to

embodied

intelligence

that

operates

in

physical

space.

Hardware  Requirements  This  course  is  technically  demanding.  It  sits  at  the  intersection  of  three  heavy  
computational

loads:

Physics

Simulation

(Isaac

Sim/Gazebo),

Visual

Perception

(SLAM/Computer

Vision),

and

Generative

AI

(LLMs/VLA).
  Because  the  capstone  involves  a  "Simulated  Humanoid,"  the  primary  investment  
must

be

in

High-Performance

Workstations
.

However,

to

fulfill

the

"Physical

AI"

promise,

you

also

need

Edge

Computing

Kits

(brains

without

bodies)

or

specific

robot

hardware.

1.  The  "Digital  Twin"  Workstation  (Required  per  Student)  
This  is  the  most  critical  component.  NVIDIA  Isaac  Sim  is  an  Omniverse  application  
that

requires

"RTX"

(Ray

Tracing)

capabilities.

Standard

laptops

(MacBooks

or

non-RTX

Windows

machines)

will

not

work
.

●  GPU  (The  Bottleneck):  NVIDIA  RTX  4070  Ti  (12GB  VRAM)  or  higher.  ○  Why:  You  need  high  VRAM  to  load  the  USD  (Universal  Scene  
Description)

assets

for

the

robot

and

environment,

plus

run

the

VLA

(Vision-Language-Action)

models

simultaneously.
 ○  Ideal:  RTX  3090  or  4090  (24GB  VRAM)  allows  for  smoother  
"Sim-to-Real"

training.
 ●  CPU:  Intel  Core  i7  (13th  Gen+)  or  AMD  Ryzen  9.  ○  Why:  Physics  calculations  (Rigid  Body  Dynamics)  in  Gazebo/Isaac  are  
CPU-intensive.
 ●  RAM:  64  GB  DDR5  (32  GB  is  the  absolute  minimum,  but  will  crash  during  
complex

scene

rendering).
 ●  OS:  Ubuntu  22.04  LTS .  ○  Note:  While  Isaac  Sim  runs  on  Windows,  ROS  2

(requires  specific  AMI).  ●  Cost  Calculation:  ○  Instance  cost:  ~$1.50/hour  (spot/on-demand  mix).  ○  Usage:  10  hours/week  ×  12  weeks  =  120  hours.  ○  Storage  (EBS  volumes  for  saving  environments):  ~$25/quarter.

2.  Local  "Bridge"  Hardware  You  cannot  eliminate  hardware  entirely  for  "Physical  
AI."

You

still

need

the

edge

devices

to

deploy

the

code

physically.

●  Edge  AI  Kits:  You  still  need  the  Jetson  Kit  for  the  physical  deployment  phase.  ○  Cost:  $700  (One-time  purchase).  ●  Robot:  You  still  need  one  physical  robot  for  the  final  demo.  ○  Cost:  $3,000  (Unitree  Go2  Standard).

3.  The  Latency  Trap  (Hidden  Cost)  
●  Simulating  in  the  cloud  works  well,  but  controlling  a  real  robot  from  a  cloud  
instance

is

dangerous

due

to

latency.
 ●  Solution:  Students  train  in  the  Cloud,  download  the  model  (weights),  and  flash  
it

to

the

local

Jetson

kit.

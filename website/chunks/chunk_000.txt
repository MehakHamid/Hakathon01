Hackathon  I:  Create  a  Textbook  for  Teaching  
Physical

AI

&

Humanoid

Robotics

Course

The  future  of  work  will  be  a  partnership  between  people,  intelligent  agents  (AI  software),  and  robots.  This  shift  won't  necessarily  eliminate  jobs  but  will  change  what  humans  do,  leading  to  a  massive  demand  for  new  skills.  We  have  already  written  a  book  on  AI  agents.  Therefore,  
we

want

you

to

write

a

textbook

to

teach

a

course

in

Physical

AI

&

Humanoid

Robotics

(The

course

details

are

documented

below).

Excel  in  the  Hackathon  and  Launch  Your  Journey  as  an  
AI

Startup

Founder

🚀

We’ve  recently  launched  Panaversity  (panaversity.org) ,  an  initiative  focused  on  teaching  
cutting-edge

AI

courses.

Alongside

this,

we’re

working

on

publishing

our

first

book,

which

you

can

explore

at

ai-native.panaversity.org
.

Our

next

milestone

is

to

build

a

portal

where

authors

can

create

AI-native

technical

textbooks,

and

readers

can

easily

access

and

learn

from

them

using

AI

Agents.

We

also

plan

to

publish

O/A

Level,

Science,

Engineering,

and

Medical

AI-native

books

to

support

students

and

professionals

across

disciplines.

If

you

perform

well

in

this

hackathon,

you

may

be

invited

for

an

interview

to

join

the

Panaversity

core

team

and

potentially

step

into

the

role

of

a

startup

founder

within

this

growing

ecosystem.

You

will

get

a

chance

to

work

with

Panaversity

founders

Zia,

Rehan,

Junaid,

and

Wania

and

become

the

very

best.

You

may

also

get

a

chance

to

teach

at

Panaversity,

PIAIC,

and

GIAIC.

Requirements   You  are  required  to  complete  a  unified  book  project  using  Claude  Code  and  Spec-Kit  Plus.
